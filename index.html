                <h3>History</h3>
                <p>The history of the sport can be traced back in India, but invented/adopted by British officers.
                    Games involving shuttlecocks have been around before, but the first ever game of what can be
                    considered badminton was played but those British officers. The name Badminton was named after the
                    Duke of Beaufort's Badminton House, Badminton being a name of a village name.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="info-block double-span glass-background">
                <h3>Rules</h3>
                <p>A round consists of rallies. A round is won after a player earns 21 points. If both players reach 20
                    points, then the target is raised to 22. This continues on until 29-29, then in this case it's first
                    to score 30. Best out of three rounds. <br>

                    To score points, the shuttlecock must land within the opponent's court. If the shuttlecock lands
                    outside, then the opponent scores a point. <br>

                    At a start of a rally, the players stand diagonally of each other. The server stands the left
                    service court if their score is odd, and on the right if even. After the rally is won by the server,
                    the server serves again now from the other side. If the server loses the rally, the opponent then
                    serves and goes and serves from the correct side according to their score.
