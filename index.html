                <h3>History</h3>
                <p>The history of the sport can be traced back in India, but invented/adopted by British officers.
                    Games involving shuttlecocks have been around before, but the first ever game of what can be
                    considered badminton was played but those British officers. The name Badminton was named after the
                    Duke of Beaufort's Badminton House, Badminton being a name of a village name.</p>

                <h3>Rules</h3>
                <p>A round consists of rallies. A round is won after a player earns 21 points. If both players reach 20
                    points, then the target is raised to 22. This continues on until 29-29, then in this case it's first
                    to score 30. Best out of three rounds. <br>

                    To score points, the shuttlecock must land within the opponent's court. If the shuttlecock lands
                    outside, then the opponent scores a point. <br>

                    At a start of a rally, the players stand diagonally of each other. The server stands the left
                    service court if their score is odd, and on the right if even. After the rally is won by the server,
                    the server serves again now from the other side. If the server loses the rally, the opponent then
                    serves and goes and serves from the correct side according to their score.

                <p class="hidden">how to stand properly. There are different stances for attacking, defending, and playing near the
                    net. Attacking stance involves facing body sidewards, raising both arms, then swinging to hit
                    the shuttlecock. Defending involves keeping the body low, the racket waist height. Net stance
                    needs you to step forward with one foot and extend your arm from the same side.</p>
                <p class="hidden">The court is small, so maximizing movement is necessary. From the starting position (center of
                    your court) you can only move 2-3 steps forwards, 2-3 steps backwards, and 1 step to the sides
                </p>
                <p class="hidden">Service is the first step in starting a rally. There are two serves, high serve and low serve.
                    High serve tries to hit the back of the opponent's court the low serve the front.</p>
                <p class="hidden">Almost indefensible move in badminton. Forehand smash is like throwing a ball, backhand smash has
                    you looking away from the net and hitting the shuttlecock with your backhand, and jumping smash
                    is a forehand smash but executed mid-air.</p>
                <p class="hidden">These moves try to exploit the opponent's need to try and catch the shuttlecock. Dropshot tries
                    to aim for the front, while the lob aims for the back.</p>
