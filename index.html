                <h3>History</h3>
                <p>The history of the sport can be traced back in India, but invented/adopted by British officers.
                    Games involving shuttlecocks have been around before, but the first ever game of what can be
                    considered badminton was played but those British officers. The name Badminton was named after the
                    Duke of Beaufort's Badminton House, Badminton being a name of a village name.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="info-block double-span glass-background">
                <h3>Rules</h3>
                <p>A round consists of rallies. A round is won after a player earns 21 points. If both players reach 20
                    points, then the target is raised to 22. This continues on until 29-29, then in this case it's first
                    to score 30. Best out of three rounds. <br>

                    To score points, the shuttlecock must land within the opponent's court. If the shuttlecock lands
                    outside, then the opponent scores a point. <br>

                    At a start of a rally, the players stand diagonally of each other. The server stands the left
                    service court if their score is odd, and on the right if even. After the rally is won by the server,
                    the server serves again now from the other side. If the server loses the rally, the opponent then
                    serves and goes and serves from the correct side according to their score.

                    handle.</p>
                <p class="hidden">how to stand properly. There are different stances for attacking, defending, and
                    playing near the
                    net. Attacking stance involves facing body sidewards, raising both arms, then swinging to hit
                    the shuttlecock. Defending involves keeping the body low, the racket waist height. Net stance
                    needs you to step forward with one foot and extend your arm from the same side.</p>
                <p class="hidden">The court is small, so maximizing movement is necessary. From the starting position
                    (center of
                    your court) you can only move 2-3 steps forwards, 2-3 steps backwards, and 1 step to the sides
                </p>
                <p class="hidden">Service is the first step in starting a rally. There are two serves, high serve and
                    low serve.
                    High serve tries to hit the back of the opponent's court the low serve the front.</p>
                <p class="hidden">Almost indefensible move in badminton. Forehand smash is like throwing a ball,
                    backhand smash has
                    you looking away from the net and hitting the shuttlecock with your backhand, and jumping smash
                    is a forehand smash but executed mid-air.</p>
                <p class="hidden">These moves try to exploit the opponent's need to try and catch the shuttlecock.
                    Dropshot tries
                    to aim for the front, while the lob aims for the back.</p>

                <p>The court is small, so maximizing movement is necessary. <br>
                    Badminton being footwork heavy, a whole host of exercises and drills are needed to develop the
                    proper skills to do the footwork. A lot of emphasis is needed to have the proper strength, agility,
                    dexterity, and stamina to move quickly and efficiently with explosive energy.</p>

                <h3>Smash</h3>
                <p>
                    Smash is usually a finisher move in badminton. It is the act of violently sending the shuttlecock
                    speeding through air, away from your opponent. Because of it's near indefensibility, this is a very
                    important skill to know. Muscles needed for the skills includes the upper back, forearms, shoulders,
                    lower back
                    <br>
                    These exercises all try to focus the arms, back, and core, all muscle groups needed to deliver a
                    deadly smash. So by exercising those muscles, one can develop their smash to greatness.

                <h3>grip </h3>
                <p>The grip is the proper hold of the racket. The thumb on the wide side, and the rest gripping the
                    handle. This is important because it can reduce injuries, allows for greater range of motion, more
                    efficient hits, and stops your racket from flying away. That last one something that happened (still
                    does) that I remember very vividly. Something that can be fixed with a towel grip, but something
                    that a good grip strength and proper grip technique can help. <br>
                    A lot of the exercise here focuses on the wrist, but some of them also focuses on the arms. Good
                    grip strength is important for a proper badminton grip. So by developing grip strength, we also
                    improve our badminton grip. Though, even if a good grip can only truly be developed with actual
                    practice, increasing grip strength is still a good idea. Same with the arms strength.</p>

                <h3>why have a plan?</h3>
                <p>A fitness plan makes one's goal much clearer and realistic. It makes it clear what you're trying to
                    achieve, instead of trying to aim for the vague notion of "getting healthy". It also allows you to
                    customize your path to your needs. Following an online blog on how to diet could word, but it would
                    be much better if you customized it to your needs. Everyone is different. And so should your diet.
